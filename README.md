## Social-Network-API
Social network for friends

Inspiration

A social media network API that utilises Mongo and Mongoose. Users can be created and they have the ability to add their thoughts. There is also the ability to add and delete friends, react to users thoughts as well as delete. This is a backend application that relies on either Insomnia or Postman to use.

Challenges

Working purely on backend is challenging - there are a lot of moving parts to the code. Making sure all the routes worked correctly and setting up the folder structure took a while to understand. Also, it takes some time manipulating the insomnia to work how you THINK it should work and figuring out why it doesn't do what you think it should. 


Further Development

Adding a front end to this, based on user input as opposed to seed data. Allowing users to follow each other. It would be cool to see what this would look like as a full application with front and back end. 

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
